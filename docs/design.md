# Design document

## Introduction
This is a pathfinding visualizer application for the Data Structures Project course in Bachelor's programme in Science at the University of Helsinki.

## Purpose
A performance comparison of different pathfinding algorithms and visualization to illustrate how algorithms work in a graphical interface.

## Background
Pathfinding algorithms provide the shortest path from source to destination. Grids are used to represent graphs and graph search algorithms are used to determine the shortest path between two vertices in a graph.

## Scope
In this project two well known pathfinding algorithms will be compared in terms of time and distance. The algorithms in comparison are Dijkstra's algorithm and Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*). The application will be implemented using Java and its latest graphic framework JavaFX.
