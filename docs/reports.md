# Weekly reports

## Week 1
This week I have spent mostly writing the design document and learning the pathfinding algorithms which are in comparison, namely Dijkstra's algorithm and Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*). I also spent time learning the basics of graphic framework JavaFX which will be used for visualization.

## Week 2
Designed and implemented initial user interface for the application. So far the user interface has a grid representing graph with source and destination nodes. Below the grid there are two buttons which purpose is to start the algorithms for finding shortest paths. Next week I will start implementing Dijkstra's algorithm and visualising it.
