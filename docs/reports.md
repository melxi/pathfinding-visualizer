# Weekly reports

## Week 1
This week I have spent mostly writing the design document and learning the pathfinding algorithms which are in comparison, namely Dijkstra's algorithm and Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*). I also spent time learning the basics of graphic framework JavaFX which will be used for visualization.
